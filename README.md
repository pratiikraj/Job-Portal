# Job-O-Hunt

Job-O-Hunt is a full-stack **MERN** (MongoDB · Express · React · Node.js) Job Portal that streamlines every step of the hiring workflow — from posting openings to accepting candidates. Users choose a role (**Applicant** or **Recruiter**) at sign-up, and the platform tailors every screen to that role.

> Login sessions are persistent and all REST API endpoints are secured with JWT token verification.
